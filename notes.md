    - The csv should contain a row for each holding matching the following headers
    |User|First Name|Last Name|Date|Holding|Value|
    - The **Holding** property should be the name of the holding account given by the **financial-companies** service
    - The **Value** property can be calculated by `investmentTotal * investmentPercentage`
    - The new route in the admin service handling the generation of the csv report should return the csv as text with content type `text/csv`
- Ensure use of up to date packages and libraries (the service is known to use deprecated packages but there is no expectation to replace them)
- Make effective use of git

We prefer:
- Functional code
- Ramda.js (this is not a requirement but feel free to investigate)
- Unit testing

EVERYTHING TO BE DONE IN THE ADMIN SERVICE!!

TODO:
- Fix at node 20
- Change to async / await
